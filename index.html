	<h1>Welcome To <br> <span class="my_name">Rehmatpal Singh's<br></span> first website!!!</h1>
	<h3>Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy, if both are frozen.</h3>
	<p>I'm a student of class 9th and I'm now learning Web Development Basics. I want to become a good programmer. I'm with programming for 1.5 years. My main goal is to learn programming languages for <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI(Artificial Intelligence)</a> and Robotics, that's why I'm learning python. 
	<a href="https://indiastemfoundation.org/atal-tinkering-lab/">ATL(Atal Tinkering Lab)</a> its a very good place for students for learning about robotics. You can search about it onto the google. Now I'm working on a project, based on <a href="https://www.python.org">python</a> and web developing. I'm also going to learn the basics of JavaScript, for interactive webpages. I'm also familier with scratch(A programming language for making games).

	<H3>Become an efficient programmer.</H3>
	<p>This is my first website and I'll make more while practicing more. I'm now only a baby Developer. I'm able to built the webpages like this. But after practicing, I'll be able to make websites for a large scale business. I'm going to start taking coding challenges after learning and practicing more about programming.
